# About This Project

This is a [Reloaded II](https://github.com/Reloaded-Project/Reloaded-II) Mod Loader mod that provides Discord Rich Presence support for Shadow The Hedgehog Players on Dolphin.

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sewer56lol/ShadowTheHedgehog-RPC/master/Example.png)

This project has no reliance/dependency on Dolphin and should hopefully work with just about any version of the emulator.

## Supported Titles
- Shadow The Hedgehog [NTSC-U] (GUPE8P)

## How to Use

A. Setup a game profile in Reloaded that launches Dolphin Emulator.

B. Install and Enable the mod like a regular Reloaded II mod.
